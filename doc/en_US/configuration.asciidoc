= The plugin configuration

= General configuration

The plugin does not have general configuration.

Note that when the plugin is activated, it performs two actions:

* Installation and configuration of apcupsd to manage a USB UPS
* Creation of equipment to declare the created USB UPS

= Configuration of equipment

As mentioned above, a first device is created upon activation. It is functional for a local USB ups.

You can add other equipment if you have other inverters on the network for example.

The plugin is in the Monitoring category.

===== Settings

The equipment has 3 parameters:

* Address: the address of connection for the APC (127.0.0.1 by default) information
* Port: listening port of the apcupsd (default 3551) service
* Power: the power of the ups (necessary to have access to the consumption)

Attention: Please enter an ip address and not a name for the address, this one is used to identify which emits a push event

For power, it is easily identifiable in the name of the template (Back - Up 550 USB for example, 550 is power)

==== Use

The equipment has a widget for the dashboard.

Consumption is available to be integrated into the energy plugin for example via a calculation between the load and the power of the inverter.

Event information will be useful for triggering scripts, as well as the status.

Battery life can be a good complement in the scenarios triggered on status for example.
